# Faculty Management System

The Faculty Management System is a console-based application developed in C# that serves as a simple yet effective tool for managing information about students, doctors, and employees within a faculty setting.

## Overview

This project employs object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to organize the codebase into three main classes: `Student`, `Doctor`, and `Employ`. Each class represents a specific role within the faculty and shares a common base class, `Human`.

## Key Features

- **User Management:**
  - Add students, doctors, and employees with relevant details.
  - Update user information interactively.
  - Delete users based on their unique ID.

- **Role-specific Details:**
  - Students have attributes such as level and GPA.
  - Doctors can manage a list of courses they are responsible for.
  - Employees have a specific role associated with them.

- **Interactive Console Interface:**
  - Users are prompted with a menu system for seamless interaction.
